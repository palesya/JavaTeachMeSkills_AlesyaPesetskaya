JULIET: What man art thou that thus bescreen'd in night
So stumblest on my counsel?
JULIET: My ears have not yet drunk a hundred words
Of that tongue's utterance, yet I know the sound:
Art thou not Romeo and a Montague?
JULIET: How camest thou hither, tell me, and wherefore?
The orchard walls are high and hard to climb,
And the place death, considering who thou art,
If any of my kinsmen find thee here.
JULIET: If they do see thee, they will murder thee.
JULIET: I would not for the world they saw thee here.
JULIET: By whose direction found'st thou out this place?
